Description
-----------

This plugin adds menu items to the hypeWall menu that directs a user to the 'Add new video' page of the iZAP Videos plugin (tested only with my revised version of iZAP Videos!) and to the 'Add photos' page of Tidypics respectively. Of course, you would have either iZAP Videos or Tidypics or both plugins installed for the menu items to appear.

In the same way as it's done here for the menu items for iZAP Videos and Tidypics other new menu items could get added to the hypeWall menu, too, using this plugin as starting point.


Requires
--------

Tested on 2015-10-25 (I've only tested functionality added by the hypeWall-iZAP Videos and Tidypics plugin, i.e. hypeWall menu items/icons showing up correctly. On newer versions the menu icons added by hypeWall itself didn't show up either).

- For Elgg 1.8:
	* HypeWall plugin version 2.2.2 (this is the most recent version of HypeWall working for me on Elgg 1.8; available at https://github.com/hypeJunction/hypeWall/releases/tag/2.2.2).


Suggests
--------

* iZAP Videos plugin (https://elgg.org/plugins/1914043),
* Tidypics plugin (https://elgg.org/plugins/385077).


Installation
------------

1. If you have installed a previous version of the hypeWall-iZAP Videos and Tidypics plugin disable the plugin in the admin section of your site and then remove the plugin folder from the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
2. Copy the hypewall_izap_videos_tidypics folder in your mod directory,
